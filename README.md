# Capitula-Counter
This pipeline automatically counts the number of Sphagnum capitula in your images and produces crops of all the images, annotated images, which can be used to check the annotations, a CSV-file of the annotations, which can be used in annotation software (i.e. VGG), and a CSV-file with the automated count and the corrected count for all images.
